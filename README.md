### About myself

I am a recent graduate of Industrial Engineering (Data Science major), having consistently achieved a place on the Dean's list throughout my studies. I am a creative and motivated individual with strong analytical and self-learning skills. My experience spans Python, SQL, Office, and other tools, as well as leadership and management in high-pressure environments. I excel at multitasking, possess excellent interpersonal communication skills, and have a high level of self-discipline.

I am currently seeking opportunities and challenges in the fields of data and project management.

:mortar_board::bulb: Beyond my studies, I actively engage in projects to continuously expand my knowledge and expertise in the realm of data science.
